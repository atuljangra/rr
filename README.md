This is a fork from the original rr repository of MOzilla. I'm trying to figure out some problem while installig rr.
rr is a lightweight tool for recording and replaying execution of applications (trees of processes and threads).  More information about the project, including instructions on how to install, run, and build rr, is at [http://rr-project.org](http://rr-project.org).

Or go directly to the [installation and building instructions](https://github.com/mozilla/rr/wiki/Installation).

Please contribute!  Make sure to review the [pull request checklist](https://github.com/mozilla/rr/wiki/Submitting--a-pull-request:-Checklist) before submitting a pull request.
